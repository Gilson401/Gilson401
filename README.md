## Welcome to my Github.

### Since you got here, know a little about me:

I am a junior developer and formallystarted working in the area in August 2021. <br />I currently work at Investfy as a front-end developer. <br />At Investfy I gained experience in: <br />

* Vuejs,
* Nuxtjs,
* Vuex,
* TailwindCSS, 
* Docker,
* Practice with Github as a team,

I also have knowledge in the MERN stack, which I learned in my training course at the Infnet institute.<br />

### I'm 43 years old (I'm young but mature). 
I'm very willing to learn new technologies and take on new challenges. <br/>
If you are willing to hire someone with little experience for your team, how about someone who already has experience in a corporate environment?
