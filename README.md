## Welcome to my Github.

### As you got here, get to know a little more about me:

I am a junior developer and formally started working in the area in August 2021. <br />I currently work at Investfy as a front-end developer. <br />At Investfy I gained experience in: <br />

* Vuejs,
* Nuxtjs,
* Vuex,
* TailwindCSS, 
* Docker,
* Practice with Github as a team,
* SCRUM routines.

I also have knowledge in the MERN stack, which I learned in my training course at the Infnet institute.<br />

### I'm 43 years old (I'm young but mature). 
I'm very willing to learn new technologies and take on new challenges. <br/>
If you are willing to hire someone with little experience for your team, how about someone who already has experience in a corporate environment?<br/>
I have **16 years of experience** as an administrative assistant at the former BR Distribuidora, now Vibra Energia. 


### You might find it interesting to know about me:
* I am married, with 3 teenage children. I love my family.
* I like Magic The Gathering, Kingo Of Fighters and Microsoft Excel.
* I like to reflect on the meaning of life, our mission in the world.
* Taste of dried apricot, tamarind, simple beers.
* I'm eclectic for music: lofi, trance, Indian music and 80's funk.

### And what else?
In addition to coding for Investfy I have been working on personal projects such as my stock market monitoring tool and stock options.<br />
Made in React and Node, this tool helps me in decision making about asset entry time.
